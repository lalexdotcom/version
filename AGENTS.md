# Agent Operating Rules

## Pair Programming Protocol

1. User leads, agent follows. Wait for the explicit next step.
2. One step at a time. Do not preview future steps unless asked.
3. Be concise. No boilerplate, no over-engineering.
4. No trailing questions ("should I continue?"). Deliver and stop.
5. No unsolicited suggestions. Flag issues in one sentence; do not act.
6. Confirm before large changes (more than a few files or significant refactor).
7. When two approaches reach the same result, choose the non-destructive one —
   or ask first. Never pick a data-losing path (reset, drop, overwrite, force)
   when a data-preserving one exists.
8. No hollow praise or flattery ("Great idea!", "Excellent question!", etc.).
9. A question is answered, not acted on — even if it implies an action.
   Proposing is part of answering; changing anything is not. No edit, no
   dispatch, no commit without explicit validation.


## Language

ALWAYS use **French** language for chat. Everything else: **English**.

## Formatting

Run the project's linter/formatter after every modification if one is configured.

## Git

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`, e.g. `fix(devcontainer): export PATH
in lifecycle scripts`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`,
`perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. A breaking change takes a `!`
after the type/scope and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. The body explains why, not
what.

## Comments

A comment says why, never what: the code already says what. Write one only
where a reader would otherwise get it wrong: a non-obvious constraint, a
failure mode that forced the design, an alternative that looks better and
isn't (and why). Name the concrete evidence (the error message, the version,
the flag that does not exist) rather than a vague "for safety". Keep it short:
the fewest sentences that carry the reason; no preamble, no repeating what the
surrounding comments already said. A comment that narrates history ("was X, now
Y") or restates the next line is deleted, not kept. When the code changes, its
comment changes in the same edit, or goes.

## Scripts

A script a human runs — a development helper, a one-off — goes in `scripts/`,
written in TypeScript and run with `pnpm exec tsx scripts/<name>.ts`. No bash,
no inline `node -e`. Until the project has its own `tsconfig.json`, rely on
tsx's defaults rather than adding one.

Logic a CI workflow runs is the exception: it stays inline in the job's `run:`
block, in shell. Calling `scripts/` from a workflow would drag a whole Node
toolchain into the job to execute a few lines, and actionlint already runs
ShellCheck over every `run:` block.

## Tooling — Serena (symbol-aware MCP)

Serena's symbolic tools are PRIMARY for code; built-in Read/Glob/Grep/Edit are
SECONDARY and must not touch code files when a Serena equivalent exists.

- Explore → `get_symbols_overview`; read a symbol → `find_symbol` (`include_body`);
  callers → `find_referencing_symbols`; definition/overrides → `find_declaration` /
  `find_implementations`.
- Edit → `replace_symbol_body` / `insert_before_symbol` / `insert_after_symbol` /
  `replace_content` (`replace_in_files` to span files); rename → `rename_symbol`;
  delete → `safe_delete_symbol`.
- After an edit → `get_diagnostics_for_file`: language-server errors for any
  language, without a per-language linter being configured.
- Absent under `--context claude-code`, do not look for them: `read_file`,
  `list_dir`, `find_file`, `search_for_pattern`, `create_text_file` and
  `execute_shell_command` are excluded by that context (the built-ins cover them);
  `move`, `inline` and `type_hierarchy` exist only in the JetBrains plugin.
- Built-in Read/Edit/Grep on code only as fallback (Serena failed or file
  unparseable). Read/Edit are fine for non-code (`.md`, JSON, YAML, TOML,
  config, lockfiles).
- Self-check before any Read/Glob/Grep/Edit on a code file: is there a Serena
  tool for this? If yes, switch — every time, not once per session.
- Subagents: every subagent prompt that touches code MUST carry this same rule.
- `.serena/project.yml` → `language_servers` lists the servers Serena starts
  (`typescript` and `bash` by default). When a change adds the first file of
  another language, add its server to that list in the same change, then ask
  the user to reconnect Serena (`/mcp`): the file is read at startup only, and
  neither `activate_project` nor `restart_language_server` reloads it.

## Memory

Serena owns memory. `write_memory` / `read_memory` / `list_memories` /
`delete_memory` are the only store: their files live in `.serena/memories/`,
they are versioned with the project, and they are what the next session reads.

Do not write to Claude Code's own file-based memory. Its `MEMORY.md` holds a
single entry pointing here and nothing else — a fact recorded in two places
drifts, and the copy Serena cannot see is the one that goes stale.

This rule covers deliberate project knowledge only. MemPalace is a different
job and stays exactly as the plugin ships it: its own hooks archive the
conversation on their own, and its MCP tools answer recalls on demand. Do not
read that as an instruction to disable it.

## Onboarding — First Run

When starting on an unknown or fresh codebase, run a codebase tour before any
task:

1. `get_symbols_overview` on the root and key directories.
2. Populate Serena memory with: stack, entry points, conventions observed.
3. Report a one-paragraph summary to the user before proceeding.

Do not ask the user to describe the project — explore first, ask only what
cannot be inferred.

## Model & Effort Policy (binds superpowers § Model Selection)

Superpowers names tiers, never models. This is the binding mapping, and it
governs **every** subagent dispatch — superpowers or not.

| Tier     | `model` | `effort` |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| cheap    | haiku   | low      |
| standard | sonnet  | medium   |
| capable  | opus    | high     |

Use these short aliases, not full model IDs — the Agent tool's `model`
parameter only accepts `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `fable`, and
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` takes an alias too. A full ID pins a snapshot that
goes stale; nothing here should carry one.

- **Never dispatch a subagent without an explicit `model`.** An omitted model
  falls back to `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` — a default, not a decision.
- **Always pass `effort` too.** An omitted effort inherits the session level
  (`high`), cancelling most of the saving a cheap tier is chosen for.
- Tier choice follows superpowers § Model Selection: complete-spec task over
  1-2 files → cheap; multi-file integration, debugging, and all reviewers →
  standard (mid-tier is the floor — turn count beats token price);
  architecture, design, and the final whole-branch review → capable. Fix-loop
  rounds 4-5 escalate one tier above the implementer that got stuck.

## Project

- `pnpm run build` — production build
- `pnpm run dev` — watch mode
- `pnpm run test` / `pnpm run test:watch` — Rstest
- `pnpm run lint` — Biome lint
- `pnpm run format` — Biome format
